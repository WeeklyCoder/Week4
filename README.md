# Week4 | Progress bars
Did it just crash? Is it stack? Only the progress bar can unveil the truth. Code one and banish all doubt.

## üìÉ Description:
They're everywhere! Whether you're downloading files, installing a software, waiting for a web page to load, +, progress bars inform about the status of things and reduce uncertainty. They are visual indicators showing the advancement of tasks/processes.

## üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Rules:
This week's going to be a treat! Dive deeper into visuals and code progress bars your own way. As a sample, the progress bar of [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com). Click [here](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week4/blob/main/linkedin%20progress%20bar.mp4) to play the animation.

The rule is simple, use the resources provided to clone the loading animation as closely as you can.

## ‚ú® Variation:
There's obviously nothing special about LinkedIn loading animation. Pick any progress bar you like and clone it.

## üí° Where to start? (Ideas)
It‚Äôs always Input, Process, Output.
- To get started, use **[this](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week4/blob/main/WeeklyCoder_Week4.pde)** bare minimum code.
- Let you start by loading the LinkedIn logo as svg. Click **[here](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week4/blob/main/linkedin_logo.svg)** to download it.
- Study the progress bar closely, play it as many time as you need, build one element at a time.

## ü•® Twists
- What if it showed a percentage? What if it showed an estimated time? What if it fades away when loading is completed? +
